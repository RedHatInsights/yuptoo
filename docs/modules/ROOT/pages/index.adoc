== Overview
The Yuptoo service is responsible for processing bulk uploads of hosts.
A client(rh-cloud-plugin/satellite) will create a specially crafted tarball and send the file to the Insights Ingress service. The Ingress service will notify yuptoo via Kafka that a tarball has arrived for processing. Yuptoo downloads the tarball, performs top level validation, and sends the host JSON to the Insight's Host Inventory service.
